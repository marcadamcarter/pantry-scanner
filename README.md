## Getting Started (Local Xcode)

> You‚Äôll need a Mac with Xcode if building locally. CI/CD via Codemagic does not require you to own a Mac.

   cd pantry-scanner
   ```
2. Open in Xcode:
   ```bash
   open PantryScanner.xcodeproj
   ```
3. Target ‚ûú **Signing & Capabilities** (Release):
   - Team: your Apple team
   - **Automatically manage signing**: ON
4. Run on a simulator or device.

## CI/CD with Codemagic

- Workflow file: [`codemagic.yaml`](./codemagic.yaml)
- What the pipeline does:
  - Installs the Apple Distribution **certificate** from Codemagic‚Äôs secure storage
  - Fetches/creates a matching **App Store** provisioning profile for `com.northpadreisles.PantryScanner`
  - Builds an **.ipa** from the **.xcodeproj**
  - (Optionally) uploads to **TestFlight**

### Required Codemagic setup (one-time)

- **Teams ‚Üí Integrations ‚Üí App Store Connect**: add your ASC API key (tied to the correct Apple Team)
- **Teams ‚Üí Code signing identities**:
  - Upload or generate an **Apple Distribution** certificate (e.g., `PantryScannerDistCert`)
  - (Optional) Upload a manually created **iOS App Store** provisioning profile for the bundle ID

> No secrets are stored in the repository; they live in Codemagic.
